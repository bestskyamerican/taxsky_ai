## PRESS RELEASE #1: Launch Announcement

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

# TaxSky AI Launches Revolutionary AI-Powered Tax Filing Platform
## File Your Taxes in 15 Minutes Through Simple Chat Conversation

**SAN JOSE, CA – January 2025** – TaxSky AI, a Silicon Valley-based fintech startup, today announced the launch of its groundbreaking AI-powered tax preparation platform that allows users to file their taxes through a simple chat conversation in as little as 15 minutes.

The platform, available at taxskyai.com, eliminates the traditional complexity of tax preparation by replacing confusing forms with an intuitive AI assistant that guides users through the entire filing process using natural language conversation.

### Key Features:

- **Conversational Filing**: Users simply describe their financial situation in plain language, and the AI handles the rest
- **Smart Document Processing**: Upload W-2s and 1099s by taking a photo – AI automatically extracts and validates all data
- **Maximum Refund Guarantee**: Proprietary algorithms identify deductions that traditional software misses
- **Multi-Language Support**: Available in English, Vietnamese, and Spanish
- **Bank-Grade Security**: SOC 2 Type II certified with 256-bit encryption

"We built TaxSky AI because we believe no one should need a degree in accounting to file their taxes," said [CEO Name], founder and CEO of TaxSky AI. "Our AI understands that you 'made $72,000 and have 2 kids' just as well as a human accountant would – but it finds more deductions and works 24/7."

### Early Results Exceed Expectations

During beta testing with over 10,000 users, TaxSky AI delivered impressive results:
- **Average refund**: $3,247 (18% higher than industry average)
- **Average filing time**: 15 minutes (compared to 8+ hours with traditional methods)
- **User satisfaction**: 4.9/5 stars
- **Deductions found**: $1,200+ more than competing software

### Pricing

TaxSky AI offers transparent, competitive pricing:
- **Basic (Federal Only)**: FREE
- **Plus (Federal + State)**: $49
- **Premium (Self-Employed)**: $89

All plans include unlimited chat support, audit protection, and a maximum refund guarantee.

### Availability

TaxSky AI is available now at taxskyai.com for the 2025 tax season. The platform currently supports residents of California and all no-income-tax states, with additional state support rolling out monthly.
