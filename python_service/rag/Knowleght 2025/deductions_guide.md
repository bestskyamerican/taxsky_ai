## Decision Tree: Standard or Itemized?

```
Step 1: Calculate potential itemized deductions
        - SALT (max $10,000)
        - Mortgage interest
        - Charitable donations
        - Medical (over 7.5% AGI)
        = Total Itemized

Step 2: Compare to Standard Deduction
        - Single: $15,000
        - MFJ: $30,000
        - HOH: $22,500

Step 3: Choose the HIGHER amount
```

### Example:
```
Filing Status: Single
Standard Deduction: $15,000

Itemized:
- SALT: $10,000
- Mortgage Interest: $8,000
- Charity: $2,000
Total Itemized: $20,000

$20,000 > $15,000 → ITEMIZE! (saves more)
```

## Tax Planning Tips

### 1. Bunching Strategy
If near the standard deduction threshold:
- Bunch 2 years of charitable donations into 1 year
- Prepay property tax (if allowed)
- Itemize in "bunch" year, standard deduction in other year

### 2. Maximize Pre-Tax Deductions
Priority order:
1. 401(k) up to employer match (free money!)
2. HSA (triple tax benefit)
3. 401(k) to max
4. Roth IRA

### 3. Track Everything
Keep receipts for:
- Medical expenses
- Charitable donations
- Work-related expenses
- Home office (if eligible)
