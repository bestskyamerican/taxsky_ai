# 401(k) Retirement Plan Rules - 2025

## Overview
A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan. Contributions are made through payroll deduction BEFORE taxes are taken out.

## 2025 Contribution Limits

| Category | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Employee contribution (under 50) | $23,500 |
| Employee contribution (50 or older) | $31,000 (includes $7,500 catch-up) |
| Total employee + employer | $70,000 |
| Total employee + employer (50+) | $77,500 |

## Key Rules

### Tax Treatment
- **Contributions**: Tax-deductible (reduces taxable income)
- **Growth**: Tax-deferred (no tax until withdrawal)
- **Withdrawals**: Taxed as ordinary income
- **NO INCOME LIMIT**: Unlike IRA, 401(k) deduction has NO income limit!

### How It Shows on W-2
- **Box 12, Code D**: Employee 401(k) contributions
- **Box 12, Code E**: Employee 403(b) contributions (similar to 401k)
- **Box 1** is REDUCED by 401(k) amount (already tax-deferred)

### Example:
```
Gross salary:        $121,000
401(k) contribution: -$12,000
Box 1 (W-2):         $109,000  ← IRS only taxes this amount
```

## 401(k) vs IRA

| Feature | 401(k) | Traditional IRA |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Through | Employer | Personal account |
| 2025 Limit | $23,500 | $7,000 |
| Income limit for deduction? | NO LIMIT | Yes ($89k single) |
| Employer match? | Yes (free money!) | No |

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I have both 401(k) and IRA?
**A: YES!** They are separate. You can contribute to both.

### Q: Is there an income limit for 401(k) deduction?
**A: NO!** Unlike IRA, 401(k) is always deductible regardless of income.

### Q: What if I have 401(k) and want IRA too?
**A:** You can still contribute to IRA, but:
- Traditional IRA deduction phases out if income > $79k (single)
- Roth IRA is usually better option for high earners

### Q: What is employer match?
**A:** Free money! If employer matches 50% up to 6%:
- You contribute 6% ($6,000 on $100k salary)
- Employer adds 3% ($3,000)
- Total: $9,000/year!

## Important Notes for Tax Calculation

1. **Box 1 already excludes 401(k)** - Do NOT subtract again!
2. **Box 3 and 5 include 401(k)** - Social Security/Medicare still taxed
3. **Check for Roth 401(k)** (Code AA) - This is AFTER-tax, different treatment
