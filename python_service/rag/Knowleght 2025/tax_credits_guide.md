# Tax Credits Guide - 2025

## Credits vs Deductions: Key Difference

| Type | How It Works | Value |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Deduction** | Reduces TAXABLE INCOME | Saves (amount × tax rate) |
| **Credit** | Reduces TAX DIRECTLY | Dollar-for-dollar savings |

**Example:**
```
$1,000 deduction at 22% bracket = $220 savings
$1,000 credit = $1,000 savings (much better!)
```

## Refundable vs Non-Refundable Credits

| Type | If Credit > Tax Owed |
|------|---------------------|
| **Non-Refundable** | Reduces tax to $0, no refund |
| **Refundable** | Get the excess as refund! |
| **Partially Refundable** | Some refundable, some not |
