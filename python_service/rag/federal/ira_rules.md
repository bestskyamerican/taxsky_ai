An IRA is a personal retirement account you open yourself (not through employer). There are two main types: Traditional IRA and Roth IRA.

## Decision Tree: Which IRA is Best?

```
START: Do you have 401(k) at work?
│
├─ NO → Traditional IRA (fully deductible!) ✅
│
└─ YES → What's your income?
         │
         ├─ Under $79k (single) → Traditional IRA (deductible) ✅
         │
         ├─ $79k - $89k (single) → Traditional (partial) or Roth
         │
         └─ Over $89k (single) → What's your income?
                                 │
                                 ├─ Under $165k → ROTH IRA ✅ (best option!)
                                 │
                                 └─ Over $165k → Backdoor Roth IRA
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I have both 401(k) AND IRA?
**A: YES!** They are completely separate accounts with separate limits.
- 401(k): $23,500 limit
- IRA: $7,000 limit
- Total possible: $30,500/year in tax-advantaged retirement savings!

### Q: I have 401(k) and make $109,000. Can I deduct IRA?
**A: NO.** Your income ($109k) exceeds the $89k limit for single filers with 401(k). 
**HOWEVER**, you CAN contribute to Roth IRA (no deduction, but tax-free growth)!

### Q: What's better - more 401(k) or add IRA?
**A:** First, get full employer 401(k) match (free money!). Then:
- If income < $89k: Traditional IRA (deductible)
- If income $89k-$165k: Roth IRA (tax-free growth)
- If income > $165k: Max 401(k), then Backdoor Roth

### Q: Can I contribute to both Traditional AND Roth IRA?
**A: YES**, but the $7,000 limit is COMBINED. Example:
- $4,000 Traditional + $3,000 Roth = $7,000 total ✅
- $5,000 Traditional + $5,000 Roth = $10,000 ❌ (over limit!)

### Q: What if I contribute to Traditional IRA but can't deduct it?
**A:** This is called "non-deductible Traditional IRA" - generally NOT recommended because:
- Pay tax now (no deduction)
- Pay tax later (on growth)
- Roth IRA is better: Pay tax now, NO tax later!
